## Overview

The SACRED CMS is a comprehensive content management system built for the SACRED platform. It provides admin users with full control over blog posts, education resources, product recommendations, user management, and analytics.

## Architecture

### Database Schema
- **blog_posts**: Blog content management with SEO features

### Role-Based Access Control
- **admin**: Full CMS access, user management, analytics

- **user**: Standard platform access

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL schema in your Supabase dashboard:

```bash
# Execute the SQL file in Supabase SQL Editor
# File: /database/cms_schema.sql
```

### 2. Storage Setup
Create a storage bucket for media files:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Storage
2. Create bucket named "media"
3. Set bucket policy to allow authenticated users to read
4. Set bucket policy to allow admin/editor roles to upload/delete

### 3. Create Admin User

After creating your first user account, promote it to admin:

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```
